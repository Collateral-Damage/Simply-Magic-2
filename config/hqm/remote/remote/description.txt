Simply Magic 2 seeks to teach individuals the basis of magic mods in a world that is immersive and tech-free. This quest book is not necessary for progression but can be useful to users who do not know where to start. Small rewards are given throughout. Each questline is independent of another and you are able to pick and choose the mods you wish to play. Enjoy! - Team Collateral Damage
