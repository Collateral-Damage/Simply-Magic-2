For example if you created the altar out of oak wood planks and glass caps then your spell would only be able to have 2 effects. If you put in a spell that had more than 2 effects it could explode. Once built to finally create the spell place the book into the lectern and throw in a blank rune. This starts the creation of any spell, next just follow the items required (shown above the lectern). Once complete the spell with drop in the altar and you can right click to name and select an icon for that spell once you exit that menu you will be able to right click the spell to cast it.",
